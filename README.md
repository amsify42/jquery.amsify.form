## Amsify Form Plugin

This plugin provides a way to divide forms in sections, validate fields and masking of inputs.

For making form tags take effect, you can run the plugin this way

``js
  $('form').amsifyForm();
``

We will divide the explanation in three parts.
1. Form Validations
2. Masking of Inputs
3. Form Sections
