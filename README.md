# Amsify Form Plugin

This plugin provides a way to divide forms in sections, validate fields and masking of inputs.

For making form tags take effect, you can run the plugin this way

```js
  $('form').amsifyForm();
```

Now, the every form tag will start getting validated based on rules we apply

```html
  <form method="post" action="">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
```

We will divide the explanation in three parts.
1. Form Validations
2. Masking of Inputs
3. Form Sections 


## Form Validations
